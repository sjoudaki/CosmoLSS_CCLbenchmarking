# CosmoLSS_CCLbenchmarking

We provide a version of CosmoLSS used for benchmarking the LSST-DESC Core Cosmology Library (CCL; https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL).
The code produces benchmark files for tomographic galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing,
and cosmic shear (3x2pt) including intrinsic alignments for all tomographic bin combinations,
for both analytic and histogram redshift distributions. The benchmarking is performed for both 
the angular power spectra and angular correlation functions.

Comparison plots are found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05995.pdf (Figs 12-15), and the [CCL benchmarking notebook](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/blob/master/examples/Benchmark_Comparisons.ipynb).

Further information is provided in the readme included in the tarball.

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any questions.
