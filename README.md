# CosmoLSS_CCLbenchmarking

We provide a version of CosmoLSS used for benchmarking the Core Cosmology Library (CCL).
The code produces benchmark files for tomographic galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing,
and cosmic shear (3x2pt) including intrinsic alignments for all tomographic bin combinations,
for both analytic and histogram redshift distributions. We do this for both the angular 
power spectra and angular correlation functions.

Further information is provided in the readme included in the tarball.

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any questions.
