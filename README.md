# CosmoLSS_CCLbenchmarking

We provide a version of CosmoLSS used for benchmarking the Core Cosmology Library (CCL).
The code produces benchmarking files for galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing,
and cosmic shear (3x2pt) including intrinsic alignments for all tomographic bins and scales,
for both analytic and histogram redshift distributions. We do this for both the
angular power spectra and angular correlations functions. The code assumes as input
the cosmological parameters and matter power spectrum from CCL.
